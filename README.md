# Mastermind Project

This is my implementation of the data structure ["Binary Tree"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) with Ruby!
It will include methods to do breadth and depth first search.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/binary_tree.git
$ cd binary_tree
$ ruby binary_tree.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

The previous project, [implementing Linked Lists in Ruby](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/linked_list) was a bit on the easier end. I think this is a good step up towards moderate difficulty.
I am eager to implement the binary tree especially because it has a wide variety of [applications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2130416/what-are-the-applications-of-binary-trees) and it will be another tool to put in my toolbox.

Looking forward, the most difficult part will probably be the depth/breadth searches, as I have never implemented them before although I understand the theory behind them.

## Post-Project Thoughts

This project is currently incomplete.
